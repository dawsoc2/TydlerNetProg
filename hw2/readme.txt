Team: Chandler Dawson and Tyler Sontag
Platform tested on: Ubuntu 14.04
Difficulties: the TFTP packet structure is straightforward, but debugging code
was a challenge because of the byte-by-byte level we needed to work on.
Time spent: Around 10 hours combined
We wish the Submitty link was open earlier.
